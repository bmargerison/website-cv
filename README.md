# website-portfolio

The website is built using React in order to so a little bit about my personality and interest, and summarise some of the things I've been working on. The site is hosted at bmargerison.co.uk

### Approach

I thought about how I wanted the site to look roughly in terms of design and drew it out. I then tried to find a resource that would allow me to create the site quickly and amend to my needs. That resource was ![here](/src/images/diagram.png?raw=true) so thanks to Reed Barger! 

The site uses React and Tailwind. There is no intention for this to be a learning experience for React, which is why I am comfortable using someone else's code as a framework (although it did require some significant changes and adjustments).
