# website-portfolio

Planning to be built using React, the website will show my portfolio of work and CV to circulate.

### Approach

My main interest is in displaying projects in a more engaging fashion, so along with a homepage with very brief introduction, this is where energy will be focused. I will then move on to other aspects of the CV, perhaps beginning with a one-page CV and than extracting infortmation therefrom onto separate pages should I see the benefit in doing so.
